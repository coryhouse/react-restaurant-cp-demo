# Feature Specification: Admin Food Management

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-an-admin`
**Created**: 2025-01-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create an admin feature that supports adding, editing, and removing food items. The admin page should be at the url /admin. Each food item should require all fields, and should validate form data and API responses via Zod."

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Restaurant administrators need to manage their menu items through a web interface. They should be able to add new food items to the menu, update existing items when prices or descriptions change, and remove discontinued items. All changes should be validated to ensure data quality and consistency across the restaurant's digital menu system.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an administrator visits /admin, **When** they click "Add New Item", **Then** a form appears with all required fields for creating a food item
2. **Given** an administrator fills out all required fields correctly, **When** they submit the form, **Then** the new food item is saved and appears in the menu list
3. **Given** an administrator views the admin page, **When** they click "Edit" on an existing food item, **Then** a form pre-populated with current values allows them to modify the item
4. **Given** an administrator clicks "Delete" on a food item, **When** they confirm the deletion, **Then** the item is removed from the menu permanently
5. **Given** an administrator submits invalid data, **When** the form is processed, **Then** clear error messages indicate which fields need correction

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an administrator tries to submit a form with missing required fields?
- How does the system handle duplicate food item names?
- What occurs if an administrator tries to delete a food item that doesn't exist?
- How does the system respond to network failures during save operations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an admin interface accessible at the URL path /admin
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow administrators to create new food items with all required fields completed
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow administrators to edit existing food items, updating any field values
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow administrators to delete existing food items from the menu
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate all form data before submission to ensure completeness and correctness
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate API responses to ensure data integrity
- **FR-007**: System MUST require all fields to be filled when creating or editing food items
- **FR-008**: System MUST display clear error messages when validation fails
- **FR-009**: System MUST persist all changes to food items permanently
- **FR-010**: System MUST display a list of all existing food items in the admin interface

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Food Item**: Represents a menu item available at the restaurant; contains name, description, price, category, image URL, and availability status; can be created, updated, or deleted by administrators
