# Research: Admin Food Management

## Technology Decisions

### Form Management - Tanstack Form
**Decision**: Use @tanstack/react-form for form state management
**Rationale**:
- Type-safe form handling with excellent TypeScript support
- Built-in validation integration with Zod
- Performance optimized with minimal re-renders
- Follows React patterns with hooks-based API
**Alternatives considered**:
- React Hook Form: Similar performance but less type-safe integration with Zod
- Formik: More verbose API and performance concerns with large forms

### UI Components - Material UI
**Decision**: Use @mui/material for form components and layout
**Rationale**:
- Comprehensive component library with form controls
- Built-in accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Consistent design system that can be customized with Tailwind
- Excellent TypeScript support
**Alternatives considered**:
- Headless UI: Would require more custom styling work
- Tailwind UI: Components not available as React library

### Validation - Zod
**Decision**: Use Zod schemas for form and API validation
**Rationale**:
- Runtime type validation with TypeScript inference
- Excellent integration with Tanstack Form
- Consistent validation across client and API boundaries
- Clear error messages for user feedback
**Alternatives considered**:
- Yup: Less TypeScript integration, more verbose schema definitions
- Joi: Server-side focused, not optimized for browser usage

### Styling Integration
**Decision**: Combine Material UI components with Tailwind utility classes
**Rationale**:
- Material UI provides accessible base components
- Tailwind handles spacing, layout, and responsive design
- sx prop on MUI components allows Tailwind-like utilities
- Maintains design consistency with existing application
**Alternatives considered**:
- Pure Tailwind with headless components: More development time required
- Pure Material UI theming: Less flexible for custom layouts

## Architecture Patterns

### Component Structure
**Decision**: Separate form components from page logic
**Rationale**:
- Reusable form components for add/edit operations
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Follows constitutional component-first principle

### State Management
**Decision**: Local component state with Tanstack Form
**Rationale**:
- Admin interface is isolated feature
- Form state is transient and doesn't need global persistence
- Simpler architecture without additional state management complexity

### API Integration
**Decision**: Extend existing /api/food endpoints for CRUD operations
**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing proxy pattern to json-server
- Consistent with current application architecture
- Minimal API surface changes required
