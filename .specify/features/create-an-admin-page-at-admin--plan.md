# Implementation Plan: Admin Food Management Feature

## Constitution Check
- [x] Code quality standards verified (TypeScript strict mode, ESLint compliance)
- [x] Testing coverage requirements planned (80% coverage with React Testing Library + Playwright)
- [x] UX consistency patterns identified and documented (Material UI + WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [x] Performance requirements and monitoring strategy defined (Core Web Vitals monitoring)
- [x] Security considerations addressed (Input validation, sanitization)

## Technical Context
Implementing admin food management using:
- **Tanstack Form**: Form state management and validation integration
- **Zod**: Runtime validation with TypeScript integration
- **Material UI**: Component library for consistent design and accessibility
- **Sonner**: Toast notifications for user feedback
- **Playwright**: End-to-end browser testing
- **React Testing Library**: Component and integration testing

## Architecture Overview

### Component Architecture
```
AdminPage (Container)
├── MenuItemForm (Tanstack Form + Zod + MUI)
├── MenuItemList (MUI Grid + Cards)
└── Toast Integration (Sonner)
```

### API Architecture
```
Frontend Form → /api/food (POST/PUT) → json-server → db.json
                     ↑
               Zod Validation
```

### Data Flow
1. User fills form with validation feedback
2. Form submits to API with Zod validation
3. API forwards to json-server with error handling
4. Success triggers toast and homepage redirect
5. Error triggers error toast with user-friendly message

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Setup and Dependencies
- Install Tanstack Form, Zod, Material UI, Sonner
- Configure Playwright and React Testing Library
- Set up TypeScript types and validation schemas

### Phase 1: API Extension
- Extend `/api/food` route for POST operations
- Add `/api/food/[id]` route for PUT operations
- Implement server-side validation and error handling

### Phase 2: Core Components
- Create reusable MenuItemForm with Tanstack Form + Zod
- Build MenuItemList component for existing items display
- Integrate Material UI components with proper accessibility

### Phase 3: Admin Page Integration
- Create `/admin` route with complete CRUD functionality
- Implement navigation and state management
- Add Sonner toast integration for user feedback

### Phase 4: Testing and Quality
- Implement comprehensive unit tests (80% coverage)
- Add end-to-end tests with Playwright
- Conduct accessibility and performance audits

## Quality Gates

### Gate 1: API Functionality
- [ ] POST /api/food creates new menu items successfully
- [ ] PUT /api/food/[id] updates existing items
- [ ] Server-side validation prevents invalid data
- [ ] Error responses provide meaningful feedback

### Gate 2: Form Validation
- [ ] All form fields validate according to Zod schema
- [ ] Real-time validation feedback works correctly
- [ ] Form submission prevents invalid data
- [ ] Loading states display during API operations

### Gate 3: User Experience
- [ ] Admin page accessible at /admin route
- [ ] Form supports both create and edit modes
- [ ] Success operations redirect to homepage with toast
- [ ] Error handling provides clear user guidance
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance verified

### Gate 4: Testing Coverage
- [ ] Unit tests achieve 80% minimum code coverage
- [ ] Integration tests cover complete workflows
- [ ] End-to-end tests validate critical user journeys
- [ ] Accessibility testing completed
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
1. **API Integration Complexity**
   - *Risk*: json-server proxy extension may introduce bugs
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive API testing and error handling
   - *Contingency*: Fall back to mock API for development

2. **Form State Management**
   - *Risk*: Complex form validation with Tanstack Form + Zod
   - *Mitigation*: Follow established patterns and documentation
   - *Contingency*: Simplify validation rules if integration issues arise

### Medium Risk
1. **Bundle Size Impact**
   - *Risk*: Material UI may significantly increase bundle size
   - *Mitigation*: Use tree-shaking and import only required components
   - *Monitor*: Track bundle size metrics during development

2. **Testing Complexity**
   - *Risk*: E2E testing with external API dependencies
   - *Mitigation*: Use Playwright mocking and fixtures
   - *Fallback*: Focus on component testing if E2E proves problematic

### Low Risk
1. **Toast Notification Integration**
   - *Risk*: Sonner integration or positioning issues
   - *Mitigation*: Well-documented library with simple API
   - *Alternative*: Material UI snackbars if Sonner fails

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Admin page functional at /admin route
- [ ] Complete CRUD operations working
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage achieved
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified
- [ ] Core Web Vitals within acceptable ranges
- [ ] Zero TypeScript or ESLint errors
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed successfully
