# Research Phase: Admin Food Management Implementation

## Technology Stack Research

### Form Management: Tanstack Form
- **Purpose**: Form state management, validation integration, and user experience
- **Key Features**:
  - TypeScript-first approach aligns with constitutional code quality requirements
  - Excellent performance through minimal re-renders
  - Built-in async validation support
  - Headless design works with Material UI components
- **Integration Points**: Works seamlessly with Zod for validation

### Validation: Zod
- **Purpose**: Runtime type validation and schema definition
- **Key Features**:
  - TypeScript integration for type inference
  - Comprehensive validation rules for menu item fields
  - Error message customization
  - Async validation support for API calls
- **Integration**: Direct integration with Tanstack Form via resolver patterns

### UI Components: Material UI (MUI)
- **Purpose**: Consistent design system and accessibility compliance
- **Key Features**:
  - WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility built-in (constitutional requirement)
  - Responsive design system
  - TypeScript support
  - Form components (TextField, Button, etc.)
- **Constitutional Alignment**: Meets UX consistency and accessibility requirements

### Toast Notifications: Sonner
- **Purpose**: User feedback and success/error notifications
- **Key Features**:
  - Lightweight and performant
  - Accessible by default
  - Customizable positioning and styling
  - Promise-based API for async operations
- **Usage**: Success notifications after CRUD operations, error handling

### Testing: Playwright + React Testing Library
- **Playwright**: End-to-end browser testing
  - Cross-browser compatibility testing
  - Real user interaction simulation
  - Visual regression testing capabilities
- **React Testing Library**: Component and integration testing
  - User-centric testing approach
  - Excellent TypeScript support
  - Mocking capabilities for API interactions

## Current Codebase Analysis

### Existing API Structure
- Current `/api/food` route supports only GET operations
- Uses json-server proxy pattern
- MenuItem interface already defined with id, name, price, description fields
- Need to extend for POST, PUT, DELETE operations

### Project Architecture
- Next.js 15.5.4 with App Router
- TypeScript strict mode (constitutional compliance)
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- ESLint configuration in place

### Dependencies Assessment
**Required New Dependencies:**
```json
{
  "@tanstack/react-form": "latest",
  "@hookform/resolvers": "latest",
  "zod": "latest",
  "@mui/material": "latest",
  "@emotion/react": "latest",
  "@emotion/styled": "latest",
  "sonner": "latest",
  "playwright": "latest",
  "@testing-library/react": "latest",
  "@testing-library/jest-dom": "latest"
}
```

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk
1. **API Extension Complexity**: Extending json-server proxy for CRUD operations
   - *Mitigation*: Implement proper error handling and validation at API layer

2. **Form State Management**: Complex form interactions with validation
   - *Mitigation*: Use Tanstack Form's battle-tested patterns

### Medium Risk
1. **Performance Impact**: Adding Material UI bundle size
   - *Mitigation*: Use tree-shaking and only import required components

2. **Testing Complexity**: E2E testing with external API dependencies
   - *Mitigation*: Use Playwright's mocking capabilities and test fixtures

### Low Risk
1. **Toast Integration**: Sonner integration complexity
   - *Mitigation*: Well-documented library with simple API

## Implementation Readiness Assessment
✅ **Ready to Proceed**: All technologies are well-documented and compatible
✅ **Constitutional Compliance**: All choices align with project principles
✅ **Technical Feasibility**: No blocking technical constraints identified
✅ **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive approach covers all constitutional requirements
