# Admin Food Management Feature Specification

## Constitutional Compliance
This specification MUST align with constitutional principles:
- Code Quality Excellence: All implementations must meet TypeScript and ESLint standards
- Testing Standards: Comprehensive test suite required with 80% coverage minimum
- UX Consistency: Design patterns and accessibility requirements defined
- Performance Requirements: Core Web Vitals targets specified
- Security by Design: Security considerations documented

## Feature Overview
Create an administrative interface at `/admin` that allows authorized users to add new food items and edit existing menu items. The interface will provide full CRUD operations for menu items, writing changes to the database through the existing food API, with form validation requiring all fields and user feedback through toast notifications.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-1**: Display admin page at `/admin` route with menu item management interface
- **FR-2**: Provide form to add new menu items with fields: name, price, description
- **FR-3**: Display list of existing menu items with edit functionality
- **FR-4**: Support editing existing menu items through pre-populated forms
- **FR-5**: Validate all form fields are required and not empty
- **FR-6**: Submit new/updated menu items to database via food API
- **FR-7**: Redirect to homepage after successful save operation
- **FR-8**: Display success toast notification after successful operations
- **FR-9**: Display error handling for API failures
- **FR-10**: Support both POST (create) and PUT/PATCH (update) operations

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-1**: Form submission must complete within 2 seconds under normal conditions
- **NFR-2**: UI must be responsive and accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- **NFR-3**: Form validation must provide immediate feedback
- **NFR-4**: Toast notifications must auto-dismiss after 3-5 seconds
- **NFR-5**: Price field must accept decimal values with proper validation
- **NFR-6**: All user inputs must be properly sanitized and validated

## User Stories

### US-1: Add New Menu Item
**As an** admin user
**I want to** add new menu items to the restaurant menu
**So that** customers can see and order new offerings

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Admin page displays "Add New Item" form
- Form includes fields for name, price, and description
- All fields are required and show validation errors if empty
- Price field accepts numeric input with decimal support
- Successful submission creates new menu item in database
- User is redirected to homepage with success toast

### US-2: Edit Existing Menu Item
**As an** admin user
**I want to** edit existing menu items
**So that** I can update prices, descriptions, or fix errors

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Admin page displays list of existing menu items
- Each item has an "Edit" button or link
- Edit form pre-populates with current item data
- Form validation matches add form requirements
- Successful update modifies existing database record
- User is redirected to homepage with success toast

### US-3: Form Validation and Error Handling
**As an** admin user
**I want to** receive clear feedback on form errors
**So that** I can successfully submit valid menu items

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Required field validation prevents submission of empty forms
- Price validation ensures numeric input
- Server errors display user-friendly messages
- Form retains user input on validation failures
- Loading states during API operations

## Technical Specifications

### Route Structure
- `/admin` - Main admin page with menu item management interface

### Component Architecture
- `AdminPage` - Main page component with layout
- `MenuItemForm` - Reusable form component for add/edit operations
- `MenuItemList` - Component displaying existing items with edit buttons
- `Toast` - Notification component for success/error messages

### API Endpoints Required
- Extend existing `/api/food` route to support:
  - `POST /api/food` - Create new menu item
  - `PUT /api/food/[id]` - Update existing menu item
  - Error handling and validation

### Data Model
```typescript
interface MenuItem {
  id: number;           // Auto-generated for new items
  name: string;         // Required, max 100 characters
  price: number;        // Required, positive decimal
  description: string;  // Required, max 500 characters
}

interface FormData {
  name: string;
  price: string;        // Input as string, validated/converted to number
  description: string;
}
```

### State Management
- Form state using React hooks (useState)
- Loading states during API operations
- Error state management for API failures
- Toast notification state management

### Navigation Flow
1. User navigates to `/admin`
2. For new items: Fill form ’ Submit ’ Redirect to `/` with toast
3. For edit: Select item ’ Edit form ’ Submit ’ Redirect to `/` with toast
4. All validation errors prevent submission and show inline feedback

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (80% minimum coverage)
- Form validation logic
- API request handling
- Input sanitization
- State management hooks
- Component rendering with different props

### Integration Tests
- Form submission workflows (add/edit)
- API integration with mock server
- Navigation and redirect behavior
- Toast notification display and dismissal

### End-to-End Tests
- Complete add menu item workflow
- Complete edit menu item workflow
- Form validation error scenarios
- API error handling scenarios
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

### Accessibility Tests
- Keyboard navigation through forms
- Screen reader compatibility
- Form labels and ARIA attributes
- Color contrast compliance
- Focus management

### Performance Tests
- Form submission response times
- Page load performance
- Bundle size impact measurement
- Core Web Vitals validation on admin page
